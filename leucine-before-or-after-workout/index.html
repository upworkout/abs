NutraKey Leucine (150g) From suppz.com
Immediately after a workout is the best time to take leucine. Consuming protein shakes, whey protein, or eaas after exercise will not only prevent the loss in muscle protein that would occur otherwise (because of the oxidation of leucine) but will also increase muscle protein synthesis and increase muscle. You could also take 2.5 grams of leucine before and/or during cardiovascular training. For muscle building, take one serving within one hour after exercise.

<p>Take 2.5 g of leucine (or 5 g of bcaa) 30 minutes before training to support the anabolic stimulus. When leucine is taken on an empty stomach, it’s a powerful metabolic switch that turns on protein synthesis. As mentioned before, leucine stimulates muscle growth and generally gains in muscle go hand in hand. If you exercise and want to effectively use leucine for muscle growth and maximize its effects, you should follow these steps [4]:</p>
