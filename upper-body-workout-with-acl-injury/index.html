Summit Medical Group Rehabilitation exercises, Exercise, Hamstring From pinterest.ca
Try exercises like clamshells—lying on your side with your feet together and then pulling your knees apart with a resistance band wrapped around your upper thigh—to focus in on your glutes. This exercise extends the knee without bearing any weight. Good even if you never hurt your acl. Start bending the knee as you slide your heel as far toward your butt as possible.
