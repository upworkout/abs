BUILD MUSCLE With Calisthenics // Bondi Beach Workout with Vegan Type 1 From youtube.com
Weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 are set up as split routines (two body parts per day) segmented into a series of supersets (two exercises performed one after the other) per session. Your body should be prepared for the increased demand—aka you’ll be performing more reps, sets, and an extra exercise here and there. However, each week will have a slight variation to keep things interesting while maintaining a structure. ️ choose your goal and group of exercises.
