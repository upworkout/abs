LeBron James says leg pain was a �10 out of 10� in Game 1 From fansided.com
While lebron has definitely optimized his posture to maximize the amount of butt on camera, he�s also running the risk of doing some serious damage. Lebron�s abs workout focuses on working the abs from a variety of angles, and makes slight adjustments to classic moves — like planks — to increase the difficulty and cause your abs to work harder than ever before. Last but not least, we would recommend you to follow the lebron james workout routine under the supervision of an experienced coach or trainer. The lebron james workout plan takes 4 weeks to complete, requires 4 days per week, and requires a(n) intermediate skill level.
